这份指南将帮助你在向 PaperMC 或插件开发者报告问题之前，先诊断出服务器所存在的问题。

:::caution[停止服务器并进行备份]

在按照本指南操作之前，请先停止服务器。在服务器运行时修改服务器文件会导致文件损坏。只有完全关闭服务器才能防止这种情况发生。

如果你不仔细遵循这份指南，或者在执行过程中出现错误，可能会损坏你的服务器。强烈建议你在按照这份指南操作之前备份你的服务器。将服务器文件夹打包为 .zip 格式就足够了，或者如果你愿意，也可以使用备份软件，例如 [BorgBackup](https://www.borgbackup.org/) 或 [Kopia](https://kopia.io/)。理想情况下，通过复制生产服务器的文件创建一个测试服务器会更好，但并不总是可行。

:::

如果服务器遇到问题，它会在服务器控制台上打印错误消息、创建崩溃报告并自行关闭，或者同时执行这两种操作。
如果服务器崩溃，崩溃报告将保存在 `crash-report` 目录中。如果服务器没有崩溃，这些错误消息将与其他消息一起存储在 `log` 目录中。

请注意，比最新的日志更早的日志将被压缩，而不是以纯文本文件的形式存储。

你首先需要做的是诊断这些消息。

你遇到的几乎所有问题都会在服务器控制台上打印错误消息行，这些行被称为“堆栈跟踪”。检查堆栈跟踪将帮助你找出服务器出现问题的原因。

堆栈跟踪以错误消息、异常类型和异常消息开始。

堆栈跟踪以错误消息、异常类型和异常消息开始。这些错误消息和异常消息是由你的插件或 Paper 的开发者添加的。这些消息会告诉你服务器遇到了什么问题。异常类型（如 `java.lang.RuntimeException`）会告诉你异常的类型。这将帮助开发者（以及你）了解问题的类型。一个好的起点是在 [Paper Discord](https://discord.gg/papermc) 中搜索异常类型和消息。

在异常消息下方，可能会出现许多以 `at` 开头的行，这些是堆栈跟踪的主体。这些行会告诉你问题是从哪里开始的。堆栈跟踪主体的最上面一行会确切地告诉你问题发生的位置，并且如果可能的话，会显示它来自哪里。

问题通常是由插件引起的，这是你应该首先检查的可能原因之一。

# 常见问题

## 由插件引发的问题
如果你在日志中的堆栈跟踪中发现了某个插件的名称，请前往[检查插件更新](#检查插件更新)并从那里开始阅读。在大多数情况下，堆栈跟踪中发现的插件名称就是导致问题的插件。

你可以通过将插件目录重命名为其他名称（例如 plugins-disabled），或者将插件目录打包并删除它，来禁用所有插件。

之后，尝试运行你的服务器。

如果在移除插件后问题解决了，那么你就知道是某个插件导致了这个问题。

### 二分查找法
如果你确定是某个插件导致了问题，但无法确定具体是哪个，可以尝试二分查找法。

1. 将你的插件分成两组。这两组的大小可以不同，但最好差距最小。确保相互依赖的插件分在一组。
2. 禁用这两组中的一组。你可以通过将它们的扩展名从 `.jar` 改为其他名称（例如 `.jar-disabled`），或者将它们移出 `plugins` 目录并放入一个临时目录来禁用它们。
3. 运行你的服务器并检查问题是否仍然存在。如果问题解决了，那么导致问题的插件就是被禁用的那组插件中的一个。如果问题仍然存在，那么导致问题的插件就是仍然启用的那组插件中的一个。
4. 从头开始，对可疑的插件组重复上述步骤。
重复上述步骤，对包含导致问题的插件的组进行操作。

:::caution[库插件依赖]

你安装的一些插件并不是普通的插件，而是一个库。这些库的安装方式与插件相同，但通常不提供面向用户的功能，而是被其他插件依赖以实现其功能。如果你禁用了这样的库，依赖它的插件将无法正常工作。常见的库插件包括 ProtocolLib、Vault 提供者、权限插件等。

:::

### Check plugin updates
There is a chance that your problem is already fixed in the latest release or latest build of the plugin.

Head to your plugin's official download page and check if you are using the latest build or the latest release of the plugin. If not, update it to the latest version and try to run your server again to see if the problem is resolved.

### Update library plugins
Many plugins use library plugins like ProtocolLib, and you have to download them and put them in the plugins directory.

If you don't update them to the latest version or latest build, you might experience problems related to plugins that use the library plugin.

Some library plugins tell their users to use their latest development build for support of the latest Minecraft version. You should look carefully at the requirements of your plugin.

### Check documentation
If you misconfigured your plugin or your server, it can also cause problems on your server. Many plugins provide their own documentation about how to set them up properly. Read those documents carefully and check if there is something wrong with the plugin's configuration.

If your problem is related to a plugin you use, and you still don't know how to solve it, you can try to reach out to the plugin's author. Many plugins have a way to contact their author, like a GitHub issue tracker, Discord support guild, Gitter, IRC, etc.

Below, we list other issues that may happen when running a server.

## Server does not start
When this happens, always check your `latest.log` file in your `logs` folder, you may find your issue listed here. If logs are not generating, check your startup script, as described below:

### Checking your startup script
The recommended way to start a server is via a startup script, that you can generate [here](/misc/tools/start-script-gen). Don't double click the .jar!
If you're on Windows and your terminal disappears quickly after you run, make sure there's a line at the end of the file containing just `pause`.
In case you get an error similar to `Error: Unable to access jarfile server.jar`, make sure that the .jar name in your startup script is the same as the file you downloaded. Note that Windows, by default, hides extensions, so you may need re-enable that in the Folder and Search Options in the file explorer to see the correct name of the file, extension included.

### Failed to bind to port
This may happen in two cases:
1. A server is already running, check your task manager app for Java processes.
2. `server-ip`, in `server.properties`, is configured incorrectly. Note that this option is not a placeholder for your external IP, it controls which network interfaces your server will bind to. Most of the time, it should be left empty.

### Attempted to load chunk saved with newer version

That error means that your world was created or opened in a server version that's newer than one you're currently running. Downgrading your world is not supported, so make sure to use the latest supported version of Paper. Even if you haven't joined the server, by loading your world in a newer version, it is upgraded automatically.

:::danger[Forcing the server to try to load a newer world]

The server will start if you use the `-DPaper.ignoreWorldDataVersion=true` flag. However, this is **highly not recommended, completely unsupported and may permanently corrupt your world**. If you're going to attempt this, take a backup.

:::

### Circular plugin loading

```
[15:01:04] [Server thread/ERROR]: [SimpleProviderStorage] Circular plugin loading detected!
[15:01:04] [Server thread/ERROR]: [SimpleProviderStorage] Circular load order:
[15:01:04] [Server thread/ERROR]: [SimpleProviderStorage]   Plugin1 -> Plugin2 -> Plugin3 -> Plugin4 -> Plugin1
[15:01:04] [Server thread/ERROR]: [SimpleProviderStorage] Please report this to the plugin authors of the first plugin of each loop or join the PaperMC Discord server for further help.
[15:01:04] [Server thread/ERROR]: [SimpleProviderStorage] If you would like to still load these plugins, acknowledging that there may be unexpected plugin loading issues, run the server with -Dpaper.useLegacyPluginLoading=true
```

That means your plugins are configured in a way such that they want to start before (or after) each other, which is impossible -- one has to go first. Plugins usually have reasons to want to start before each other, so when such a conflict happens, rather than picking randomly and risking issues, the server warns you about the issue and shuts down.
There's often a problematic plugin involved, and to solve this, it's preferable that you report the issue to its authors. Removing it should also fix the issue. As a last resort, you can use the `-Dpaper.useLegacyPluginLoading=true` startup flag, but it may cause hard to debug issues.

Your version of Java is outdated, check [our guide on updating it](/misc/java-install). To avoid possibly having to do more tweaks, uninstall your current version of Java, if any.
If you do have the correct version installed, your operating system may be not picking it up. Make sure you've closed and opened your terminal after installing it, and that Java is present in your `PATH` environment variable.

## Server crashes or exits unexpectedly

:::caution[Update!]

Always keep your server up to date (and take a backup before updating). Older versions are known to have on-demand crashes that can be triggered by players at any time.

:::

### Unexpected graceful shutdown
If your server shuts down normally as if you typed `/stop` or pressed a stop button in your panel, enable `debug` in `server.properties`. The next time the server shuts down, you will get a stack trace that will help you debug.

```

That message shows up when your server is taking very long (10+ seconds) to finish the current tick -- it's not a bug or crash, it's simply warning you of severe lag, that can eventually lead to a crash.
A good rule of thumb is checking the first lines of the stack trace, as that shows where the main thread was stuck at the time it was printed. Many times, that points to the root cause of the issue.
However, sometimes the issue may not be obvious or appear in the stack trace. If possible, analyze a [spark report](#spark-report) for more details, and, if you're in doubt about how to proceed, feel free to visit the [Paper Discord](https://discord.gg/papermc) for help.

### Crash without logs
If you have access to a Linux shell, run `dmesg -T | grep -i killed`. That should show how your server process was killed.
A common cause (but not the only one), if it was killed due to OOM, is that your server panel is configured with a memory limit that's too close to your `-Xmx`. Either reduce `-Xmx` (by 1-2GB is a good initial rule of thumb) or increase/disable the memory limits in your panel.
If you're using a hosting company that only provides you with a panel, you likely won't have the tools to get to the bottom of the problem. You should make a ticket with your host in this case.

## Performance and gameplay issues
Unfortunately, Paper can't replicate Vanilla behavior 100%, but it is a goal (except when it comes to exploits). If you're still experiencing a bug that cannot be reproduced in vanilla **multiplayer**, please apply a [Vanilla-like configuration](/paper/vanilla) and check if there's already an open issue in our GitHub. If not, feel free to create one.

### Strange entity/farm/redstone/spawning behavior
If you copied values of a pre-made configuration or optimization guide, now is a good time to revert the changes. Keep a copy of your current configs if you prefer, and delete the originals so they can re-generate to default values.

In case you're still experiencing such issues with default configurations, try our [Vanilla-like configurations](/paper/vanilla) but do note that this comes at a performance cost.

Also, keep in mind that singleplayer does not behave the same as multiplayer, both when it comes to spawning and certain entity behavior. For example, mobs despawn if they're over 128 blocks away from a player, and this becomes more apparent in multiplayer, especially if you're making farms where monsters go to another dimension via a nether portal. If there are players in the target dimension and they're all very far from the portal, the mob will instantly despawn -- this is intended Vanilla behavior.

### Dupes not working
Paper has some [unsupported settings](/paper/reference/global-configuration#unsupported_settings) that allow certain dupes. However, a few of them cannot be re-introduced because that would break other aspects of the server. Paper also will not re-add dupes that no longer exist in the game.

## Performance issues
### Spark report
Paper has the [spark](https://spark.lucko.me/) profiler built-in, in order to diagnose the root cause of performance issues.
For example, you can generate a report for 300 seconds by running `/spark profiler start --timeout 300`
If you want to diagnose lag spikes that last more than, for example, 100 ms, you can run `/spark profiler start --only-ticks-over 100 --timeout 300`

Look into the [spark docs](https://spark.lucko.me/docs) for a more in-depth guide on how to use it and read reports. If you're still unsure about what's the cause of your problem, you can send us the link via the [Paper Discord](https://discord.gg/papermc).

### High RAM usage
Unless you're experiencing out of memory crashes or bad garbage collection (GC) times, high memory usage is expected.

Java programs store objects in memory, in an area where we call the heap. The heap grows over time, you can set its initial value with `-Xms` and the maximum value with `-Xmx`.

It's normal that the Java process will use the RAM it's given, sometimes using a little more than `-Xmx`. This number won't go down over time, as the garbage collector (GC) rarely returns RAM to the operating system in servers. This is by itself not a problem, in fact it's beneficial: by having more heap memory to work with, GC will have to worry less about disposing of garbage, as that takes valuable processing time. This is not a memory leak and will not cause out of memory crashes, which are commonly caused by not leaving enough RAM for your OS or improperly configured memory limits in a container.

There are several different memory metrics that can be measured. For example, imagine a server in a 16GB container, running with `-Xms1G -Xmx14G`. In this case:
* **Container memory limit:** 16GB
* **Maximum heap:** 14GB
* **Current heap size:** Starts at 1GB and expands quickly. Will be between 1-14GB at any given point
* **Current heap usage:** will be smaller than the number above, and will grow and shrink in a sawtooth pattern under normal conditions

Keep in mind that different tools choose different metrics out of these to display, so the usage meter in your panel, at a glance, might not look like what a plugin will display.

### Low CPU usage
Paper is able to make use of multiple cores, but this does not necessarily mean that you will have several cores at near 100% usage. A major source of load in the server comes from the tick loop, which uses a single thread. Thus, at a certain point, more cores will not give you a performance benefit, so it's advisable to go for a CPU with high single-threaded performance and allocate a sufficient amount of threads to your server (at least 4). In servers with a high core count, this situation can translate to a low CPU usage relative to the total amount of cores.

However, if your server (especially if large) is really adamant on using only a single core, check your panel's CPU allocation setting. In certain panels, a number like `4` doesn't mean it'll use 4 cores, but instead that it will use the one core with ID 4.
